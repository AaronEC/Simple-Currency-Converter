# Simple Currency Converter

The goal of this project is to create a simple currency converter where users can enter an amount in one
currency and convert it to another currency. The app should have two drop-down
menus where users can select the currencies they want to convert from and to.
When the user enters an amount and selects the currencies, the app should display
the converted amount. The backend should retrieve currency exchange rates from a
currency API.

### Main features

* User can select between two currencies using a drop-down menu.

* The app converts between the two selected currencies.

* The app retrieves current conversion rates via an API call to open.er-api.com
